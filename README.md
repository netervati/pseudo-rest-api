# PseudoRESTAPI (⚙ Work in progress ⚙)
**PseudoRESTAPI** is a tool that enables you to create mock REST APIs quickly and easily, without requiring any language or framework skills.

## What it's trying to solve
This project aims to enhance frontend prototyping by offering a mock server that emulates the behavior of a live server, returning data in response to requests. The mock server can also provide a valuable platform for QA engineers to practice their skills by allowing them to create fake endpoints that can be tested either manually or via automation tests.

## How does it differ from existing tools?
Currently, this project doesn't offer much compared to existing tools except provide a more intuitive experience in creating mock servers. However, the project has a roadmap of planned features that have the potential to add significant value for its users.
