# Introduction

**PseudoRESTAPI** is a passion project that I have built and continue to maintain in my free time.

I had three goals in mind when I started with this project:

- To create a valuable tool for developers and QA engineers. One common pain point that developers experience when creating client prototypes is the need for server fetching. While developers with backend engineering knowledge can create their own server applications, the effort may not always be justifiable, especially when time constraints are present. To address this, I developed **PseudoRESTAPI** as a platform that offers a faster way to develop and deploy mock servers. Additionally, professionals like QA engineers can benefit from this tool for practicing manual and automated API testing.

- To learn Nuxt3 with Supabase. Vue3 is one of my favorite front-end frameworks, and when Nuxt3 was officially released in 2022, I was thrilled to learn and utilize this technology in a project. Additionally, I have been tinkering with Supabase for over a year now, making it a natural fit to combine both technologies for this project.

- To deploy a "production-ready" open-source project. While I have previously worked on personal open-source projects, only Space Distortion was released as production-ready. Since 2022, I have been eager to start another project, and **PseudoRESTAPI** presented the perfect opportunity for me to do so.

That is the brief history of this project. To get started with **PseudoRESTAPI**, please continue [here](/docs/getting-started).
